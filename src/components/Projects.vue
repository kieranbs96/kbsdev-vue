                                    I created the site as simple in Design as possible. The site was developed in GatsbyJS
                                    which is a powerful React Static Page Generator, I decided to use a React based website
                                    as I am confident in my React ability and it produces powerful and fast web apps, other
                                    technologies in the project include SASS & SVG. The blog page is build into Gatsby using
                                    the Markdown Source, so all full blog pages are build in Markdown and inline HTML.
